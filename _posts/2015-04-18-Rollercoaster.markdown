Butterflies in the stomach.
Rainbow in the sky.
Colors everywhere.
Thoughts of you in my mind.

Heartbeat thumps fast.
Smile all over the face.
Radiance flourishes.
I thought it was something real.

Calm as the sea.
Peaceful as the moonlight.
Painful as thorns.
Hopeful? not anymore.

Time has passed.
Cold wind blew.
Numb as ice.
Slip of the fingertip, feelings may fade too.
