Beautiful creature staring at me,
Eyes so soulful, face so perfect.
Lips so supple, red as cherry.
Just the sight of you lifts my weary.

Mornings are better whenever you are around.
A glaze, stare, momentary connection.
A hi, hello, good morning and good bye;
Makes my heart flutter, feels like the first time.

A simple nod, short attention.
I don't mind even if it's just infatuation.
Blessed with this feeling I thank the heavens.
Temporary it may be, I'm glad I am living.
