Can I hear those words without you blitzed?
Will you say them to me in sound mind?
Will you have the courage and sincerity to speak it?
Will I ever hear it again?

Will you answer me back if I say it first?
Or will you just listen because you don't feel the same?
Were those words really honest and true?
Or were they just lies to make me say I do?

Will you whisper it again in my ears?
Or they're only words spoken when you're loaded and sloshed?
If you can't say it back or again, will you just show it that it's real?
Coz right now, I'm having trouble believing if it is genuine or this is just a game.
