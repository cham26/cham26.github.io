You are an amazingly beautiful creature.
Shaped and woven in God's perfection.
Out of the billion people, know that you are worth it.
You are special, unique, and significant.

Know that you are spectacularly created for a reason.
You are important as the air you breath and water you drink.
Never doubt for a second your capacity to be great.
You have talents, skills, and knowledge you need to be someone you've always wanted to become.

Do not wait for people to tell you your value.
Do not ask for love and attention from people who do not appreciate you.
You only need a few to make you feel wanted and cared.
After all, you already have yourself.

Do not be blinded with wordly treasures.
Create experiences, build relationships, and make memories.
Always dream big and pursue them.
Do not be afraid, believe and you'll make it.

Love like you have never loved and been hurt before.
Give all you've got, fall, love, get hurt and love again.
Do not let your past hunt you.
Forgive yourself, it's the only way to set yourself free.

Lastly, be someone you yourself will be proud of.
Take good care of yourself, coz who else will.
Be true, honest, loyal and kind to every human soul and creature.
You only have one life to live, always make the most of it.
