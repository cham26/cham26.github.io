I will stop fighting.

I will stop chasing.

I will learn to let go.

I should let go.


There was never an us.

We were never a team.

You never considered me as your partner.

We are just two separate beings.


I've seen this coming.

I  guess it's my fault.

I've always pester you with your feelings.

I guess you were just confused and forced.


But I am slowly getting tired.

My heart is sluggishly failing,

To always prove my worth.

I guess it's time to build back the walls.
