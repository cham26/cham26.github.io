I was never the one.

I am just the one who filled the void.

The emptiness over the years that became part of you.

Yearning to get filled, to satisfy the longing.


You know this isn't real, it's just your mind letting you believe it is.

Deep inside you, you still want the exact, same piece back.

You still long for that piece and will always long for it.

And no matter what you do to connect the missing pieces it still doesn't fit.



So you settle for something else, something that will temporarily alleviate the suffering.

While trying to persuade yourself this must be it.

But all along it's just a cry for survival.

Coz at the end of the day, I am just the one who fills in the gap that can't be filled.

For I will never be enough to be the one you really need and want; and the one that will end your longing.
