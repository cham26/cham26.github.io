Raindrops are falling once again.
It slides through the glass windows,
Clatters on the ceiling wall,
Reminds me of the day I met you.

You looked far away while I kept staring at you.
So near to touch and hold,
but far away to call my own.

She had your heart I can never steal.
I just hope one day it will be free for real.
Like the raindrops free falling everywhere,
not afraid to fall and all healed.
