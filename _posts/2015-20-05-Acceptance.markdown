Im sorry, I know my feeling doesn't matter.
Im sorry, day by day I'm getting attached to you.
Im sorry, cause Im still hoping and expecting you'll
see more than what you want from me.
Im sorry, if I still don't trust your feelings.

Forgive me, for my insecurites and insanities.
Forgive me, if all I want is some assurance that you feel
the same way too.
Forgive me, if I can't seem to live up to your expectations.
Forgive me, because I am and can't be her.

I apologize for expecting too much from you.
I apologize for believing it's all true.
I apologize for everything,  I understand now where I stand.
I apologie for loving you first and wanting you to love me back.
But now I know and I understand. It's okay. I'll be fine.
