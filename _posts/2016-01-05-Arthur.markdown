Ages I have waited for you.

Right now, words can't explain how happy I am to finally meet you.

Treasure you and share my life with you.

Hundred and even thousand miles apart,

Undoubtedly, heavens crafted ways so we will never part.

Risking odds and defying laws, that love conquers all even outside our comfort zone.


Sincerest words, honest and beautiful eyes.

Thinking mind, though sometimes hardheaded and perverted,

Entices me all the time.

Planned to run away from you many times.

And ended regretting, returning back to your arms.

Now, I don't need to watch romantic movies and wish I'm the girl. Coz,

You are here, my very own love story in the making.

Ugly truth, vulnerable as it sounds, life would be empty and dull if you will not be around.

Know that I will always love you now and beyond.
